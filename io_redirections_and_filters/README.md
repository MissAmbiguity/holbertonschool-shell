I/O Redirections, Filters, and Command-Line Basics

This repository showcases concise, two-line shell scripts focusing on I/O redirections, essential commands (e.g., echo, cat, head, tail, find, wc, sort), and fundamental concepts in Linux command-line operation. Demonstrating the power of redirection, these scripts allow efficient text and file manipulation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The repository rigorously adheres to best practices, including executable scripts, newline endings, and a README.md file that succinctly explains the purpose of each script while avoiding specific commands like sed or awk.

Understanding Special Characters for Command-Line Efficiency

Part of the project highlights the significance of special characters in command-line operations, clarifying the roles of whitespace, quotes, backslashes, comments, pipes, separators, and tildes. Comprehending these characters enhances effective shell scripting, enabling users to grasp their distinct functionalities and optimize command-line efficiency.
